# tmenu: a terminal menu inspired by dmenu

What tmenu does is simple:
1. it reads stdin
2. presents a menu containing each line of stdin (delimited by newline)
3. it outputs the selected option to stdout

Use the up and down arrows to move between menu options and enter to finalize your selection.
